  In order to test account withholding SRC I create a new customer invoice

  !context
    'type': 'out_invoice'
-
  I create a customer invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_customer0, view: account.invoice_form }:
    name: 'wh src test account invoice customer'
    account_id: account.a_recv
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_sale
        name: 'Test product description'

    try:
      aws_brw.action_confirm()
    except osv.except_osv:
      pass
