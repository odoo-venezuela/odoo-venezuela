  2. Testing Sale Book.
-
  2.1 I configure the test enviroment for the test.
-
  I set the file context for sale operations.
-
    !context
        'type': 'sale'
-
  I set the company like a withholding iva agent.
-
    !python {model: res.company}: |
        rc_id = ref ( 'base.main_company' )
        rc_brw = self.browse(cr, uid, rc_id)
        rp_obj = self.pool.get( 'res.partner' )
        rp_obj.write(cr, uid, rc_brw.partner_id.id, {'wh_iva_agent': True})
-
  I check that a current period exist and it is unique.
-
    !python {model: account.period}: |
        import time
        company_id = ref( 'base.main_company' )
        period_id = self.find(
            cr, uid, time.strftime( '%Y/%m/%d' ), {'company_id': company_id})
        assert period_id, 'There is not current period for this company.'
        assert period_id, 'There only can be one current period (Not %s).' % (len(period_id))
-
  "\n\n\t Note: I try to create a sale book with basic configurations via record tag but I fail for some yaml errors. \n\t Try to do the same via python code and it works but I loose a xml id. \n\t So I decide to use the fiscal books data created in the demo data.\n"
-
  I set the fiscal book article number for the current book type.
-
  "\n\n\t Note. This case is used to resolve the dafult asignation of the article number field\n\t for the sale type. Once this section is fixed then the next test case can be deleted\n."
-
    !python {model: fiscal.book}: |
        fb_id = ref( 'fiscal_book_sale_test')
        article_number = self.default_get(
            cr, uid, ['article_number'], context=context).values()[0]
        self.write(cr, uid, fb_id, {'article_number': article_number},
                   context=context)
-
  I check that the demo sale book was correctly created.
-
    !assert {model: fiscal.book, id: fiscal_book_sale_test, string: The sale book was not correctly created.}:
        - state == 'draft'
        - type == 'sale'
        - article_number == '76'
-
  I modify the book to correspond to the current period.
-
    !python {model: account.period}: |
        fb_id = ref( 'fiscal_book_sale_test')
        fb_obj = self.pool.get( 'fiscal.book' )
        fb_brw = fb_obj.browse(cr, uid, fb_id)
        company_id = fb_brw.company_id.id
        import time
        cr_period_id = self.find(
            cr, uid, time.strftime( '%Y/%m/%d' ), {'company_id': company_id})[0]
        fb_obj.write(cr, uid, fb_id, {'period_id': cr_period_id})
-
  2.2 I check that only one sale book can exist for the same period.
-
  I try to create a new sale book for the current period. It wont.
-
    !python {model: fiscal.book}: |

            'period_id': period[0], 
            'type': 'sale',
            }
        try:
            cr.execute( 'SAVEPOINT fb_unique_period_company' )
            with mute_logger('openerp.sql_db'):
                self.create(cr, uid, values, context=context)
            cr.execute( 'RELEASE SAVEPOINT fb_unique_period_company' )
            flag = False

        assert flag, 'The sale book can not be created because there is already another book for the same period and company.'
-
  2.3 I check that when I'm creating a new sale book the default values are correctly set, and that the context is been taking into account.
-

        new_fb_id = self.create(cr, uid, values, context=context)
        fb_brw = self.browse(cr, uid, new_fb_id)
        check_conditions = {

            assert elem[0] == elem[1], elem[2] + ' (%s != %s)' % (elem[0], elem[1])
-
