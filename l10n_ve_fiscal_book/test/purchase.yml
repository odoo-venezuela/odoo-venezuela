  1. Testing Purchase Book.
-
  1.1 I configure the test enviroment for the test.
-
  I set the file context for purchase operations.
-
    !context

-
  I set the company like a withholding iva agent.

        rp_obj.write(cr, uid, rc_brw.partner_id.id, {'wh_iva_agent': True})
-
  I check that a current period exist and it is unique.
