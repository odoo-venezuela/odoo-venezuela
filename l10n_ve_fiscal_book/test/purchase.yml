  1. Testing Purchase Book.
-
  1.1 I configure the test enviroment for the test.
-
  I set the file context for purchase operations.
-
    !context
        'type': 'purchase'
-
  I check that a current period exist and it is unique.
-
    !python {model: account.period}: |
        import time
        company_id = ref( 'base.main_company' )
        period_id = self.find(
            cr, uid, time.strftime( '%Y/%m/%d' ), {'company_id': company_id})
        assert period_id, 'There is not current period for this company.'
        assert period_id, 'There only can be one current period (Not %s).' % (len(period_id))
-
  "\n\n\t Note: I try to create a purchase book with basic configurations via record tag but I fail for some yaml errors. \n\t Try to do the same via python code and it works but I loose a xml id. \n\t So I decide to use the fiscal books data created in the demo data.\n"
-
  I check that the demo purchase book was correctly created.
-
    !assert {model: fiscal.book, id: fiscal_book_purchase_test, string: The purchase book was not correctly created.}:
        - state == 'draft'
        - type == 'purchase'
        - article_number == '75'
-
  I check that the book correspond to the current period.
-
    !python {model: account.period}: |
        fb_id = ref( 'fiscal_book_purchase_test')
        fb_obj = self.pool.get( 'fiscal.book' )
        fb_brw = fb_obj.browse(cr, uid, fb_id)
        fb_period_id = fb_brw.period_id.id
        company_id = fb_brw.company_id.id

        assert fb_period_id == cr_period_id, 'The books period not correspond to the current period %s != %s' % (fb_period_id, cr_period_id)
-
  1.2 I check that only one purchase book can exist for the same period.
-
  I try to create a new purchase book for the current period. It wont.
-
    !python {model: fiscal.book}: |

        import time
        flag = True
        company_id = ref( 'base.main_company' )
        period_obj = self.pool.get( 'account.period' )
        period = period_obj.find(
            cr, uid, time.strftime( '%Y/%m/%d' ), {'company_id': company_id})
        values = {
            'name': 'Purchase Book (Test Yaml)',
            'period_id': period[0], 
            }
        try:
            cr.execute( 'SAVEPOINT fb_unique_period_company' )
            self.create(cr, uid, values)
            cr.execute( 'RELEASE SAVEPOINT fb_unique_period_company' )
            flag = False

            cr.execute( 'ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT fb_unique_period_company' )
        assert flag, 'The purchase book can not be created because there is already another book for the same period and company.'
-
  1.3 I check that when I'm creating a new purchase book the default values are correctly set, and that the context is been taking into account.
-
    !python {model: fiscal.book}: |

        period_ids.remove(cr_period_id)
        values = {
            'name': 'Another Purchase Book (Test Yaml)',

            }

        assert fb_brw.state == 'draft', 'The state was not correctly default set (%s != draft).' % (fb_brw.state,)
