  3. Testing Customer Withholding generated manually (sale).
-
  3.1 I configure and set the file enviroment.
-
  I set the context for the purchase operations at this file.
-
    !context
        'type': 'out_invoice'
-
  I check if the account i will use is of receivable type.
-
    !assert {model: account.account, id: account.a_recv, string: The account is not of receivable type}:
        - type == 'receivable'
-
  I check that Customer A is a withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1, string: Customer A is not a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent
-
  I check that Customer B is not withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_7, string: Customer B is a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent == False
-
  I check that Tax A is a withholdeable Tax.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_sale1, string: The tax is not withholdeable}:
        - ret
-
  I check that Tax B is not a withholdeable Tax.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_sale3, string: The tax is withholdeable}:
        - ret == False
-
  3.2 Test customer withholding with a Non-Wh Partner.
-
  I create a customer withholding with Non-Wh Partner. THIS CASE WILL FAIL
  ALWAYS...
  Can not create a AWI doc with a Non-Wh Partner, need to use a Wh Partner.
  That is the reason why this test is commented.
  You need to descomment this test to run it and will raise an yaml ERROR and a server exception.

-
  I create a customer withholding with a wh partner to later try to update to a Non-Wh Partner.

        currency_id: base.EUR
-
  I try to update the customer withholding partner to a Non-Wh partner, the AWI doc will not be updated because the constraint.
-
    !python {model: account.wh.iva}: |
        awi_id = ref('awi_sale_X1X')
        try:

        except Exception as e:

-
  3.3 Test customer withholding when the company is not a withholding agent.
-
  I set the company as a non-withholding agent.
-
    !record {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner}:
        wh_iva_agent: False
-
  I checking that the company is not withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner, string: The Company is a withholding agent}:
        - not wh_iva_agent
-
  Skip NO valid Case 000 (Non-Wh Company, Non-wh Partner, Non-Wh Tax)

  Skip NO valid Case 001 (Non-Wh Company, Non-wh Partner, Wh Tax)
-
  Skip NO valid Case 00N (Non-Wh Company, Non-wh Partner, No Tax)
-
  Test Case 010 (Non-Wh Company, Wh Partner, Non-Wh Tax).
-
  I create a customer withholding.
