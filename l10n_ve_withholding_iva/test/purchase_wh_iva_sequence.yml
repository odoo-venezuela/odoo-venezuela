  5. Testing the correct use of sequence when generating supplier withholding documents.
-
  5.1 I check the records i will use in this test and configure enviroment options.
-
  I check that the supplier withholding sequence code in data is loaded.
-
    !assert {model: ir.sequence.type, id: seq_type_account_wh_iva_purchase, string: The purchase awi sequence code was not correctly loaded}:
        - code == 'account.wh.iva.in_invoice'
        - name == 'Purchase Vat Withholding'
-
  I check that the supplier withholding sequence in demo was loaded.
-
    !assert {model: ir.sequence, id: seq_account_wh_iva_purchase, string: The purchase sequence was not correctly loaded}:
        - name == 'Purchase Vat Withholding'
        - code == 'account.wh.iva.in_invoice'
        - prefix == '%(year)s-%(month)s-'
        - padding == 8
        - number_increment == 1
-
  I update the supplier withholding sequence in demo to later be able to difference it and the check that have been correctly used.
-
    !record {model: ir.sequence, id: seq_account_wh_iva_purchase}:
        prefix: PURCHASE_TEST-%(year)s-%(month)s-
        number_next: 999 
-
  I configure the context for purchase operations.
-
    !context
        'type': 'in_invoice'
-
  I set the company as a withholding agent (because is the only I can create a supplier withholdings).
-
    !record {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner}:
        wh_iva_agent: True
-
  I check that the company is withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner, string: The Company is not a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent
-
  I check that the supplier that will be use exist.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1, string: The supplier used in this test exist}:
        - id
-
  I check that tax the that will be use is a withholding tax.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase1, string: The tax is not withholdeable}:
        - ret
-
  I check that the account that will be use is of payable type.
-
    !assert {model: account.account, id: account.a_pay, string: The account is not of payable type}:
        - type == 'payable'
-
  5.2 Check that the sequence is set only when the supplier withholding is set to done.
-
  I create a supplier invoice.
-
