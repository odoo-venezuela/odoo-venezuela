  7. I make test over the txt docuemnts in purchase operations.
-
  7.1 I configure the enviroment.
-
  I configure the context for purchase operations.
-
    !context
        'type': 'in_invoice'
-
  I set the company as a withholding agent (because is the only I can create a supplier withholdings).
-
    !record {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner}:
        wh_iva_agent: True
-
  I check that the company is withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner, string: The Company is not a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent
-
  I check that the supplier that will be use exist.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1, string: The supplier used in this test exist}:
        - id
-
  I check that the tax that will be use is withholdeable.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase1, string: The tax is not withholdeable}:
        - ret
-
  I check that the account that will be use is payable type.
-
    !assert {model: account.account, id: account.a_pay, string: The account is not of payable type}:
        - type == 'payable'
-
  7.2 I check that txt document with no txt lines can not be confirm.
-
  I create a txt document.
-
    !record {model: txt.iva, id: supplier_txt_iva_1}:
        #name: auto fll generic
        #period: current.
        date_start: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        date_end: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
-
  I check that the txt document is in draft state with no txt lines.
-
    !assert {model: txt.iva, id: supplier_txt_iva_1, string: the txt document was not correctly created}:
        - state == 'draft'
        - not txt_ids
-
  I try to confirm the txt document with empty txt lines.
-
    !python {model: txt.iva}: |
        txt_id = ref( 'supplier_txt_iva_1' )
        try:
            self.action_confirm(cr, uid, txt_id)
            assert False, 'The txt document can be confirm when have empty txt lines.'
        except Exception as e:
            pass
-
  I check that the txt document remains in draft state.
-
    !assert {model: txt.iva, id: supplier_txt_iva_1, string: the txt document can not pass to confirm state}:
        - state == 'draft'
-
  7.3 Using the txt document in 7.2 I check that only done withholding
  documents can be add to a txt document.
-
  I create a supplier invoice.
-
    !record {model: account.invoice, id: supplier_txt_invoice_1, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}: &supplier_txt_invoice
        nro_ctrl: PURCHASE-IVA-TXT-INVOICE-0001

            invoice_line_tax_id:
            - l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase1

  I check the invoice type, state and have not wh doc.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: supplier_txt_invoice_1, string: The invoice was not correctly created. It need to be set in draft state, a supplier invoice type (in_invoice) and have not withholding document associaded.}:
        - state == 'draft'
        - type == 'in_invoice'
        - not wh_iva_id
-
  I confirm the invoice to create the withholding document.
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: supplier_txt_invoice_1}
-
  I check that the invoice is confirmed and it generate a withholding doc.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: supplier_txt_invoice_1, string: The invoice was not correctly confirm. It need to change to open state (confirmed) and also generate and link a withholding document}:
        - state == 'open'

  I check that the withholding document state is draft.
