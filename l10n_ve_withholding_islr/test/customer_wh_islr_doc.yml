  3. I check the customer income withholding documents (Sale).
-
  3.1 I configure the test enviroment and check data and demo.
-
  I set the context for the purchase operations at this set of cases.
-
  !context
    'type': 'out_invoice'
-
  I check that only one non-withholdable concept is define.
-
    !python {model: islr.wh.concept}: |
       iwc_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [( 'withholdable', '=', False )])
       assert len(iwc_ids) == 1, ( 'Only can be defined one non-withhodeable'
           ' concepts, but %s are defined.' % (len(iwc_ids), ))
-
  I check that all the withholdable concepts have accounts type 'other' associtated and also have mandatory income rates.
-
    !python {model: islr.wh.concept}: |
       iwc_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [( 'withholdable', '=', True )])
       for iwc_brw in self.browse(cr, uid, iwc_ids):
            assert iwc_brw.rate_ids, 'All the withholdable concepts need to have rates associated'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_payable, 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding purchase acc set.'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_payable.type == 'other', 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding purchase acc of type other.'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_receivable, 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding sale acc set.'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_receivable.type == 'other', 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding sale acc of type other.'

-
  I check that the concept that will be use is withhodable.
-
    !assert {model: islr.wh.concept, id: islr_wh_concept_hprof_no_mercantiles, string: The income concept is not withholdable}:
        - withholdable
-
  I check that the product that will be use have a concept.
-
    !assert {model: product.product, id: product.product_product_4, string: Have not a concept.}:
        - concept_id.id == ref( 'islr_wh_concept_hprof_no_mercantiles' )
-
  I check that the customer that will be use is an income withholding agent and is at Venezuela.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1, string: The customer is not correctly set for this test.}:
       - islr_withholding_agent
       - country_id.code == 'VE'
       - vat
-
  I check if the account that will be use is of receivable type.
-
    !assert {model: account.account, id: account.a_recv, string: The account is not of receivable type}:
        - type == 'receivable'
-
  3.2 I check that an customer invoice confirmation will not automatic create a withholding document.
-
  I create a customer invoice with a withholdable concept (in the product).
-
    !record {model: account.invoice, id: islr_customer_invoice, view: account.invoice_form}: &customer_ai
